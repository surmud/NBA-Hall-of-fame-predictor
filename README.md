# NBA Hall of Fame Predictor
` Sinaan Younus, Surmud Jamil, Ritesh Verma `

This is our final project for CMSC320 - Introduction to Data Science. Using data on NBA hall of famers and non-hall-of-famers, we designed our own machine learning model to predict whether players will be inducted into the Naimsmith Basketball Hall of Fame. This notebook also contains some exploratory data analysis on questions that we thought were interesting.

Here is the published notebook on github pages: https://surmud.github.io/NBA-Hall-of-fame-predictor/
